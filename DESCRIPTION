Description: The getCRUCL2.0 package provides functions that automate downloading and
    importing CRU CL2.0 climate data into R, facilitates the calculation of
    minimum temperature and maximum temperature, converts elevation from
    kilometres to metres and formats the data into a tidy data frame or a list
    of raster stack objects for use in an R session. CRU CL2.0 data are a
    gridded climatology of 1961-1990 monthly means released in 2002 and cover
    all land areas (excluding Antarctica) at 10 arc-second resolution. For more
    information see the description of the data provided by the University of
    East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU),
