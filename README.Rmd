# getCRUCL2.0
## Download, and create a tidy data frame or raster stack object of CRU CL2.0 weather variables

Author/Maintainer: Adam Sparks

This function automates downloading and importing CRU CL2.0 weather
data into R, facilitates the calculation of minimum temperature and
maximum temperature, converts elevation from kilometres to metres and
formats the data into a list of tidy data frames or raster stack object for 
use in an R session. For more information see the description of the data
provided by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU),
<http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/readme.txt>.
