# getCRUCL2.0
## Download and Use CRU CL2.0 Climatology Data in R

Author/Maintainer: Adam Sparks

The getCRUCL2.0 package provides two functions that automate downloading and
importing CRU CL2.0 climatology data into R, facilitate the calculation of
minimum temperature and maximum temperature, and formats the data into a tidy
data frame or a list of raster stack objects for use in an R session. CRU CL2.0
data are a gridded climatology of 1961-1990 monthly means released in 2002 and
cover all land areas (excluding Antarctica) at 10 arc-second resolution. For
more information see the description of the data provided by the University of
East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU),
<http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/readme.txt>.

## Note

This package automatically converts elevation values from kilometres to metres.

This package crops all spatial outputs to an extent of ymin = -60, ymax = 85,
xmin = -180, xmax = 180. Note that the original wind data include land area for
parts of Antarctica.
