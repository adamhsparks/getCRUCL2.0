# Introduction to getCRUCLdata

The getCRUCLdata package provides four functions that automate importing CRU 
CL2.0 climatology data into R, facilitate the calculation of minimum temperature
and maximum temperature, and formats the data into a 
[tidy data frame](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) or a list
of [raster stack](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf) objects for use in an R session. CRU CL2.0 data are a gridded
climatology of 1961-1990 monthly means released in 2002 and cover all land areas
(excluding Antarctica) at 10 arcminutes (0.1666667 degree) resolution. For more
information see the description of the data provided by the University of East
Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU),
<https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/readme.txt>.

# Using getCRUCLdata

All four functions, `get_CRU_df()`, `get_CRU_stack()`, `create_CRU_df()` and 
`create_CRU_stack()` take the same arguments but return different types of objects
in the R session. Logical arguments are used to specify the data to retrieve and
parse. The `create_*` functions require an additional parameter, `dsn` to be
provided that states where the files are locally stored. The arguments for
selecting the climatology elements for importing are:  

* **pre** Logical. Fetch precipitation (milimetres/month) from server and
return in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **pre_cv** Logical. Fetch cv of precipitation (percent) from server and
return in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **rd0** Logical. Fetch wet-days (number days with >0.1milimetres rain per
month) and return in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **dtr** Logical. Fetch mean diurnal temperature range (degrees Celsius)
and return it in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **tmp** Logical. Fetch temperature (degrees Celsius) and return it in the
data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **tmn** Logical. Calculate minimum temperature values (degrees Celsius)
and return it in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **tmx** Logical. Calculate maximum temperature (degrees Celsius) and return
it in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **reh** Logical. Fetch relative humidity and return it in the data?
Defaults to FALSE.  
* **sunp** Logical. Fetch sunshine, percent of maximum possible (percent of
day length) and return it in data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **frs** Logical. Fetch ground-frost records (number of days with ground-
frost per month) and return it in data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **wnd** Logical. Fetch 10m wind speed (metres/second) and return it in the
data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **elv** Logical. Fetch elevation (and convert to metres from kilometres) and
return it in the data? Defaults to FALSE.  
* **dsn** *For `create_CRU_stack()`* and *`create_CRU_df()`* only. Local file path where
CRU CL2.0 .dat.gz files are located.

## Creating tidy data frames for use in R

There are two methods that this package provides for creating tidy data frames of the CRU CL2.0 climate data as a [`tibble`](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble). Depending on your needs you may need to use `create_CRU_df()`, which will create a tidy data frame of the climate elements from *locally available* files. Or you can use `get_CRU_df()`, which will automate the fetching and importing of the data files into R in one step.

The `create_CRU_df()` function is useful if you have network issues that interfere with R downloading the data files themselves from the CRU website or if you frequently work with these data and do not wish to download them every time they are needed.

The `get_CRU_df()` function automates the download process and creates tidy data frames of the CRU CL2.0 climatology elements. Files downloaded using this method may be cached in the users' local space for later use or stored in a temporary directory and deleted when the R session is closed and not saved. Illustrated here, create a tidy data frame of all CRU CL2.0 climatology elements available and cache them to save time in the future.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(getCRUCLdata)

CRU_data <- get_CRU_df(pre = TRUE,
                       pre_cv = TRUE,
                       rd0 = TRUE,
                       tmp = TRUE,
                       dtr = TRUE,
                       reh = TRUE,
                       tmn = TRUE,
                       tmx = TRUE,
                       sunp = TRUE,
                       frs = TRUE,
                       wnd = TRUE,
                       elv = TRUE,
                       cache = TRUE)
```

Perhaps you only need one or two elements, it is easy to create a tidy data frame of mean temperature only. Note that unless you specify `cache = TRUE` the files will be downloaded again and only remain available for the active R session. In this example, since `cache` is not set `TRUE` the tmp file will be downloaded to a temporary directory for use. If you wish to use the files that were previously downloaded using the `get_CRU_df()` function, then it is necessary to specify `cache = TRUE` in the arguments.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t <- get_CRU_df(tmp = TRUE)
```

The `create_CRU_df()` function works in the same way with only one minor difference. You must supply the location of the files on the local disk (`dsn`) that you wish to import.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t <- create_CRU_df(tmp = TRUE, dsn = "~/Downloads")
```

## Plotting data from the tidy dataframe

Now that we have the data, we can plot it easily using [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org) and
the fantastic [`viridis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/) package for the colour scale.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("ggplot2")) {
  install.packages(ggplot2)
}
if (!require("viridis")) {
  install.packages("viridis")
}

library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
```

Now that the required packages are installed and loaded, we can generate a figure of temperature ranges using `ggplot2` to map the 12 months.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = t, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = tmp)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "inferno") +
  coord_quickmap() +
  ggtitle("Global Mean Monthly Temperature 1961-1990") +
  facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4)
```

![Plot of global mean monthly temperatures 1961-1990](README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)


We can also generate a violin plot of the same data to visualise how the temperatures change throughout the year.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = t, aes(x = month, y = tmp)) +
  geom_violin() +
  ylab("Temperature (ËšC)") +
  labs(title = "Global Monthly Mean Land Surface Temperatures From 1960-1991",
       subtitle = "Excludes Antarctica")
```

## Saving the tidy data frame as a CSV (comma separated values file) locally

Save the resulting tidy data frame to local disk as a comma separated (CSV) file to local disk.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)

write_csv(t, path = "~/CRU_tmp.csv")

```

## Creating raster stacks for use in R or saving for use in a GIS

For working with spatial data,`getCRUCLdata()` provides two functions that create lists of [raster](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster) stacks of the data.

The `create_CRU_stack()` and `get_CRU_stack()` functions provide similar functionality to `create_CRU_df()` and `get_CRU_df()`, but rather than returning a tidy data frame, they return a a list of [raster](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster) stack objects for use in an R session.

The `get_CRU_stack()` function automates the download process and creates a raster stack object of the CRU CL2.0 climatology elements. Files downloaded using this method may be cached in the users' local space for later use or stored in a temporary directory and deleted when the R session is closed and not saved. Illustrated here, create a tidy data frame of all CRU CL2.0 climatology elements available and cache them to save time in the future.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
CRU_stack <- get_CRU_stack(pre = TRUE,
                           pre_cv = TRUE,
                           rd0 = TRUE,
                           tmp = TRUE,
                           dtr = TRUE,
                           reh = TRUE,
                           tmn = TRUE,
                           tmx = TRUE,
                           sunp = TRUE,
                           frs = TRUE,
                           wnd = TRUE,
                           elv = TRUE,
                           cache = TRUE)
```

Create a list of raster stacks of maximum and minimum temperature. To take advantage of the previously cached files and save time by not downloading files, specify `cache = TRUE`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmn_tmx <- get_CRU_stack(tmn = TRUE,
                         tmx = TRUE,
                         cache = TRUE)
```

The `create_CRU_stack()` function works in the same way with only one minor difference. You must supply the location of the files on the local disk (`dsn`) that you wish to import.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t <- create_CRU_stack(tmp = TRUE, dsn = "~/Downloads")
```

## Plotting raster stacks

Because the stacks are in a list, we need to access each element of the list individually to plot them, that's what the `[[1]]` or `[[2]]` is, the first or second element of the list.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(raster)

plot(tmn_tmx[[1]])
```
![Plot of raster layers from minimum temperature stack](README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

To plot only one month from the stack is also possible. Here we plot maxmimum temperature for July. Note that we use indexing `[[2]]` as before but append a `$jul` to the object. This is the name of the layer in the raster stack. So, we are telling R to plot the second object in the `tmn_tmx` list, which is `tmx` and from that raster stack, plot only the layer for July.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(tmn_tmx[[2]]$jul)
```
![Plot of maximum temperatures for July](README-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

## Saving raster objects to local disk

The raster stack objects can be saved to disk as geotiff files (others are available, see help for `writeRaster` and `writeFormats` for more options) in the `Data` directory with a tmn or tmx prefix to the month for a filename.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(raster)

dir.create(file.path("~/Data"), showWarnings = FALSE)
writeRaster(tmn_tmx$tmn, filename = paste0("~/Data/tmn_", names(tmn_tmx$tmn)), bylayer = TRUE, format = "GTiff")

writeRaster(tmn_tmx$tmx, filename = paste0("~/Data/tmx_", names(tmn_tmx$tmn)), bylayer = TRUE, format = "GTiff")
```

> **ABSTRACT:** We describe the construction of a 10-minute latitude/longitude data
set of mean monthly surface climate over global land areas, excluding Antarctica.
The climatology includes 8 climate elements - precipitation, wet-day frequency,
temperature, diurnal temperature range, relative humidity,sunshine duration,
ground frost frequency and windspeed - and was interpolated from a data set
of station means for the period centred on 1961 to 1990. Precipitation was first
defined in terms of the parameters of the Gamma distribution, enabling the 
calculation of monthly precipitation at any given return period. The data are
compared to an earlier data set at 0.5 degrees latitude/longitude resolution and
show added value over most regions. The data will have many applications in
applied climatology, biogeochemical modelling, hydrology and agricultural
meteorology and are available through the School of Geography Oxford 
(http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk), the International Water Management Institute
"World Water and Climate Atlas" (http://www.iwmi.org) and the Climatic
Research Unit (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk).
